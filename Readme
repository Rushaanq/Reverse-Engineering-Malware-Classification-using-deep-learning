Introduction
In this project, I analyze the behavior of Windows 32-bit executable files using Cuckoo Sandbox to extract dynamic API sequences. These API sequences are then compared to various deep learning approaches, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bi-directional LSTM, and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), to determine the accuracies of each approach.

Conclusion
I use a behavior-based approach to classify malware instances from their behavior on execution. By choosing the highly customizable and detailed Cuckoo Sandbox, we can safely execute and monitor malware, extracting detailed reports. I analyzed 211 malware and 61 benign instances, extracting API calls from each report to preprocess them into sequences for our deep learning models.

The following results were obtained:

LSTM model: 82.93% accuracy, 449ms prediction rate per sample
Bi-Directional LSTM: 85.37% accuracy, 2000ms prediction rate per sample
GRU model: 90.24% accuracy, 900ms prediction rate per prediction

This work helps in understanding and using the behavior at execution of malware to detect malware instances, especially useful for new and less-known malware. The models can be customized and trained with specific malware family samples and benign files from an environment for better detection and classification.
